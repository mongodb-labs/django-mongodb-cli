Django MongoDB CLI

About
=====

Django MongoDB CLI (``dm``) is a command-line tool for testing and managing 
`django-mongodb-backend <https://github.com/mongodb-labs/django-mongodb-backend>`_ 
integration with third-party Django libraries.

The CLI provides tools to:

* Clone and manage multiple Django-related repositories
* Configure and run test suites for third-party libraries with MongoDB backend
* Track compatibility and test results for supported Django packages
* Organize repositories into groups for easier management

This tool is primarily used for testing django-mongodb-backend with `MongoDB's 
Django fork <https://github.com/mongodb-forks/django>`_ and is not a requirement 
for using django-mongodb-backend in production applications.
